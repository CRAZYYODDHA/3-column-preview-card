## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
### The challenge

Building the 3 column preview card component to match the design as closely as possible.

### Solution
I have created 3-column preview card using HTML and CSS. The problem was published on [Frontmentors](frontendmentor.io) it was an amazing challenge to do and I enjoyed building it.
I am willing to do some more challenges on frontendmentor.io
